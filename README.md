# Description

This application is a nodeJS express and sequelize backend for a ecommerce store. It is designed as a proof of concept for a backend and contains no front end development. It contains a mock seeded database. The routes also include CRUD operations for all of the different models in the database. The sequelize database uses three models with their relationships defined in the index/js in the models root directory.
